Your task is to identify those lines that do not contain all three scores for students.

There will be no more than  rows of data. 
Each line will be in the following format: 
[Identifier][English Score][Math Score][Science Score]

Output Format

For each student, if one or more of the three scores is missing, display:

Not all scores are available for [Identifier]



awk '{if ($4 == "") print "Not all scores are available for",$1;}'

awk '{if (length($4)==0) print "Not all scores are available for " $1}'

awk 'NF<4{print"Not all scores are available for "$1}'

awk '{ if ( $2 && $3 && $4 ) ; else print "Not all scores are available for "$1}'
